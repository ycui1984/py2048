Play the popular game of 2048

A PyGTK implementation of [Gabriele Cirulli's game of 2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) which is itself a clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024) and based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

##Installation
Open a terminal and enter the following command:

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ralphembree/py2048/master/install.sh -q -O - | bash

This will put the executable file in /usr/games.
To run the program, simply type py2048 into the command prompt or click py2048 in your Games menu.

##Features
* Moves can be undone with the click of a button.
* Games can be saved in user-specified files to be resumed later.
* Grid size can be resized to preference.
* In addition to the keyboard, there are two kinds of mouse interaction:
  * Swipe: click and hold and then move in the direction desired
  * Click: each section of the grid (top, bottom, left, right) when clicked will move the tiles in a different direction.  The cursor will be an arrow pointing in the direction the tiles would go if you clicked.
* The colors in the grid can be rerandomized at any time (without messing up your game).

##How to play

The arrow keys determine which direction all of the tiles move.  Tiles with the same number that hit each other merge into one tile.  Each time tiles are moved, another tile is added to the board.  The game is over when no more tiles can be merged.
